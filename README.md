# Textsteganography Pytorch-Version

## Summary
#### This repository contains a Pytorch reimplementation for previously prevailing text steganography methods based on LSTM language model.
#### The codebase is heavily insprired by the [ADG-based steganography methods](https://github.com/Mhzzzzz/ADG-steganography)
#### If you have any questions, please conntect us immediately by the e-mail(pengwanli@fudan.edu.cn)


## Steganography methods
#### Huffman-coding based method (HC.py)
#### Arithmetic-coding based method (AC.py)
#### Patient-huffman based method (P-HC.py)
#### ADG-based method (ADG.py)
